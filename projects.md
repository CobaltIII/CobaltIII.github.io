These are some projects I've worked on for either my coursework or during my general free time.

## Forecasting model for Mutual Funds

My friend [Sakshat](https://sak-drago.github.io/) and I looked into the optimization of investment strategies when it comes to Mutual Funds using the SARIMAX model proposed by Dénes Csala. We achieved 75% forecasting accuracy by incorporating over 30 exogenous variables, improving predictions of mutual funds NAV.

## A research paper about the existence of an isomorphism between Tower of Hanoi Graphs and the Sierpiński triangle 

The most notable project in my undergrad (for now) came in my course of Discrete Mathematics. We had to create a mathematical paper with a sizable novelty, and my group chose to study Hanoi Graphs with the lens of Fractals from dynamical systems and Group theory from Abstract Algebra. Finally, we were able to conjecture some solid statements regarding the existence and shape of these graphs. You can see the paper here. It is currently being reviewed by a few members of the mathematical fraternity, and depending on their consensus, we may choose to move forward with refining the research.

## Simulating Cryptographic Attacks [Python]
Guide : [Maria Eichlseder’s lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLfX_2xRB__0OhOzA-rl6kvnLCCtrRoS7x)

Demonstrating the Wiener's Attack on RSA with a small private exponent, using the concept of continued fractions. Also I gave a robust proof of the correctness of the attack mathematically.

## Operating System Shell Functionality Modules [C/C++]

As assignments for the Operating Systems course, we had to create multiple modules for functions of the shell of Linux systems like Schedulers using Round Robin policy, Page allocator, and a Simple Multithreader.

## Angry Birds Game [Java, Gradle]

As the project for my Advanced Programming course, we had to re-create the game Angry Birds using Java. For the implementation, me and my partner chose Gradle as the base framework and Box2D for the physics.

## Interpreter for a C-type language [Python]

As a side project, I decided to read the book How to write an interpreter in Go by Robert Nyfrost. Using the knowledge I gained there I was able to conjure an interpreter that implements a limited C-like language using BNF concrete syntax. It uses Pratt-Parsing to evaluate expressions using Top Down Operator Precedence.

## Movie Recommendation System with Linear Algebra [Python]

One of my first projects in college was a basic movie recommendation system that used the 25m dataset for movie reviews. It then uses an algorithm of projection to see which users like which movies and recommends movies such that you get the favorites of those clusters of people who like the entered movie.

## Implementing Dimensionality reduction using Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and Fisher Discriminant Analysis (FDA) [Python]

For an assignment of my Statistical Machine Learning course, we needed to perform different permutations of PCA, FDA, Quadratic Discriminant Analysis (QDA) and Linear Discriminant Analysis (LDA) and return the results. It was one of the most fun and nuanced assignments I've gotten to do in my undergrad.

## Making a compiler and executor compatible with RISC-V architecture [Python]

The project implements a subset of RV32I (RISC-V 32-bit integer) instruction set, making an assembler and simulator for the same. The Assembler converts assembly code written in RISC V syntax to byte-code and the Simulator executes the byte-code line by line.

## Other tidbits

Despite being a complete amateur currently, I try to contribute to the open source projects

For example, I've contributed to:

* Manim - Helped out with opacity issues of Vector Animation
